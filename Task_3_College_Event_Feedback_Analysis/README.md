# Task 3 - College Event Feedback Analysis

This project is developed as part of the Data Science and Analytics Internship.

## Description
A data-driven analysis of student feedback for college events to identify satisfaction trends and areas of improvement.  
This project uses Python, pandas, TextBlob, and Seaborn to perform sentiment analysis and visualize results.

## Dataset
- `event_feedback.csv` - Raw feedback from students
- `cleaned_event_feedback.csv` - Cleaned dataset after preprocessing

## Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas
- TextBlob
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Steps Performed
1. Imported and loaded the feedback dataset
2. Cleaned data (removed missing feedback, normalized text)
3. Applied sentiment analysis using TextBlob
4. Classified feedback into Positive, Neutral, and Negative
5. Visualized sentiment distribution and rating trends
6. Generated insights and recommendations for event improvement

## Insights
- Majority of feedback is **positive**, indicating high satisfaction.
- Negative sentiment mostly related to **audio, duration, and lack of interactivity**.
- Ratings correlate well with sentiment, validating results.

## Recommendations
- Improve **audio and venue arrangements**.
- Add more **interactive sessions**.
- Optimize **event duration** for better engagement.
- Collect feedback regularly to improve future events.

## Skills Gained
- Data Cleaning
- Sentiment Analysis
- Data Visualization
- NLP using Python
- Reporting and Insights
